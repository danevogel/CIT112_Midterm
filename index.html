                <p>Now that you know how to access it, here is more information to help you decide whether you need to be a pervert or criminal to use it.</p>
                <p>(C) It is unknown when the dark web initially emerged, but the term was first widely used in 2009. Reporting began to use the term largely when Silk Road became a popular subject.</p>
                <p>(D) So who uses it then? The dark web can be used for illicit purposes like searching for assassins or illegal pornography, but it can also be used by journalists and whistleblowers to communicate or by citizens in countries with strict regulations.</p>
                <p>(E) The dark web is just a small part of the deep web which is the part of the web whose contents are not indexed by standard web search-engines</p>
